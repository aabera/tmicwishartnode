                    ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation ensures that a laboratory has a

                    assays, demonstrating we have the ability and competence to

                    The Wishart Node is on track to attaining ISO 15189
                    certification. With this certification, we will have the
                    standard and capability of a medical testing lab under
                    international standard requirements. ISO 15189 certification
                    demonstrates a lab has a proper quality management system in
                    place, covering various aspects including sample processing
                    and reporting of metabolites as per medical testing
                    standards.

                    The Wishart Node is also seeking CLIA certification. The
                    Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) statute of
                    1988 (USA) and its associated regulations specify the
                    quality standards for laboratory testing performed on human
                    specimens, including blood, body fluid, and tissue, for the
                    purpose of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of disease,
                    or assessment of health. CLIA certification demonstrates a
                    test was done under strict standards, and may be necessary
                    in some situations, such as reimbursement from a (USA)
                    patientâ€™s insurer.
