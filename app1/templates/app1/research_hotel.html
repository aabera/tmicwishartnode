            In 2011, Dr. Wishart began a training program within TMIC known as
            the ‘Research Hotel’. The program’s mission is to provide new
            researchers with access to core facilities, office and bench space,
            as well as to provide active training and mentoring. National and
            international visitors wanting to learn more about metabolomics
            under the supervision of TMIC’s expert staff and scientists are
            welcome to apply. Please note that the visitors are expected to
            arrange for their accommodations and cover the costs of their
            living/travel expenses while visiting. The pins on the map show
            countries researchers have travelled from to be trained by our
            metabolomics experts.
