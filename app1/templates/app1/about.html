                Successful Development of Colon Polyp Screening Test In 2013,
                <a href="">Metabolomics Technologies Incorporated (MTI)</a>
                discovered a panel of 12 urinary metabolites that could be used
                to detect colonic polyps and early colon cancer using NMR
                spectroscopy. The test is called PolypDx. However, NMR
                instruments are not used in clinical settings. MTI asked the
                Wishart Node at TMIC to help them convert this 12-compound
                <a href="">PolyDx</a> assay into a 3-compound assay that was
                compatible with clinically-approved mass spectrometers. By 2016,
                the Wishart Node had successfully converted the assay to a
                3-metabololite test that worked on clinical mass spectrometers.
                Now the PolypDx test is offered in dozens of clinical labs in
                the USA as a laboratory-developed test (LDT) for rapid,
                non-invasive colon polyp screening.<br />

                Ever Wondered What’s In Cow’s Milk?

            <p class="text-left text-justify text-dark">
                Ever Wondered What’s In Cow’s Milk? Milk production is a
                trillion-dollar-a-year business. As big as it is, not much is
                known about the many chemicals or nutrients that can be found in
                commercial cow’s milk. In 2019, in collaboration with dairy
                scientists at the University of Alberta, the Wishart Node at
                TMIC completed the most comprehensive chemical analysis of milk
                ever undertaken. Using a combination of 5 different in-house
                metabolomic assays (NMR, ICP-MS, GC-MS, LC-MS) and extensive
                literature mining, they identified nearly 2400 compounds
                (nutrients, breakdown products, antibiotics, pesticides) that
                can be found in commercial cow’s milk. All this information,
                along with detailed descriptions of these molecules and their
                roles, is now available in the milk composition database (MCDB).

                Key Triggers for Alzheimer’s Disease

            <p class="text-left text-justify text-dark">
                Key Triggers for Alzheimer’s Disease Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
                affects almost one-third of people over the age of 85 and costs
                the North American health system >$350 billion a year. While
                amyloid fibrils and deposits play a role in the etiology of the
                disease, it is not clear what actually triggers AD. The Wishart
                Node at TMIC, in collaboration with AD researchers across the
                US, recently helped in the discovery that bacterially-derived
                bile acids can be found in the brains of AD patients. This
                unexpected finding suggests that a breakdown in gut integrity,
                along with the blood-brain barrier permeability, may be a key
                trigger leading to the inflammatory response that ultimately
                results in amyloid build-up, brain damage, and dementia. This
                discovery opens new avenues to detect, prevent, and possibly
                treat AD. Metabolic Network Analysis Reveals Altered Bile Acid
