                    Metabolomics is the study of small molecules called
                    metabolites. Metabolomics is an emerging field of “omics”
                    research specializing in the near-global analysis of
                    small-molecule metabolites (1500 daltons) found in living
                    organisms. Metabolomics is applicable in many disciplines
                    including disease diagnostics, agriculture, food and safety,
                    and pharmaceutical research and development, just to mention
                    a few. The use of metabolomics allows for the discovery of
                    biomarkers, which in turn leads to the development of
                    improved screening methods. Here are some examples of what
                    the field of metabolomics can do:

            <strong>Targeted:</strong> Metabolites, known a priori, are defined
            by the biological problem and may represent a class of molecules or
            a specific pathway.
            <br />
            <strong>Untargeted:</strong> This type of analysis involves

                    <strong>NMR:</strong> Nuclear magnetic resonance
                    spectroscopy is a non-destructive method for analyzing 3D
                    structure and molecular dynamics. It is a powerful
                    spectroscopic technique that measures radio-frequency
                    radiation absorption by nuclei within a chemical compound.
                    Radio-frequency pulses of energy are applied to the sample.
                    These pulses encourage the nuclei to move away from their
                    equilibrium and start to rotate around the axis of the
                    magnetic field. Each atom in the molecule interacts with the
                    other atoms in a unique way when different combinations of
                    pulses and delays are applied. The result is information
                    about the structural and chemical properties of certain
                    molecules. The Wishart Node uses the Chenomx NMR Suite
                    Professional v. 6.0 for identifying and quantifying
                    individual compounds based on the respective signature
                    spectra compiled in libraries. Employing targeted metabolite
                    profiling, Chenomx NMR Suite currently offers identification
                    and quantification of more than 300 compounds from 1H NMR
                    spectra of complex analyte mixtures. For the conducted
                    experiments, samples are analyzed in D2O by 1H NMR. Proton
                    (1H) NMR can detect any metabolites containing hydrogen. One
                    significant downside of NMR-based metabolomics is that this
                    technique is not as sensitive as GC-MS- or LC-MS-based
                    techniques and often requires sample amounts on the
                    milligram or sub-milligram level. Recent advances in modern
                    NMR instrumentation, though, such as introduction of
                    microcoil NMR probes, clustering first-stage preamplifiers,
                    and application of cryogenic probes, bring sensitivity of
                    NMR analyses to the nanogram level.

                    <strong>GC-MS:</strong> Historically, gas
                    chromatography-mass spectrometry, used for analyzing lipids,
                    drug metabolites, and environmental analysis, has been
                    considered the gold standard. GC technology is used for
                    metabolomics studies in animals and humans with the aim of
                    toxicology and biomarker discovery, disease diagnosis and
                    classification. It is highly sensitive and able to detect
                    almost any organic compound. One of the advantages of GC-MS
                    is that the identification is based on both a retention time
                    and a mass spectrum (a compound’s specific fragmentation
                    pattern). Compounds produce reproducible fragmentation
                    patterns when ionized by a fixed electron voltage (usually
                    70 eV), making the technique particularly valuable for
                    identification and quantification for small molecules as it
                    means it is instrument-independent and allows databases to
                    be created and shared between users. The NIST 08 Mass
                    Spectral Library is one of the most widely-used GC-MS
                    reference libraries. It contains more than 220,000 electron
                    ionization mass spectra for a wide variety of metabolites.
                    Reproducibility and robustness of the GC-MS methodology
                    allows quantitative detection of analytes, unlike proteomic
                    mass spectrometry which tends to be more qualitative.

                    spectrometry is a specialized type of mass spectrometry that
                    detects metals and some non-metals. ICP-MS works by ionizing
